# My_site

This is the first site I created for myself that involves HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and some JQuery. 
It is rather messy, but the concepts are there. 

Make sure to test out the custom context menu I have built using right click on different elements on the website.
Installation--
Requires: CSS\style.css and JS\snake.js in a sub-directory to run elements correctly.
However, the videos and pictures as of 2021-27-01, will remain broken until I fix them with public domain alternatives.
